##  Introduction

- Composing a cover letter is an integral part of your next journey - beginning the job application process and entering the professional work force.

- It is likely that you will have multiple drafts and versions of cover letters to use for the different types of positions you apply for (Dev vs Solutions, Programmer vs Manager, Front End vs Back End...)

- A Cover Letter is a lot like a pop song. They all follow a pretty similar structure, they all have the same basic themes, just changing the words. They shouldn't be too long, and shouldn't veer too far outside of their basic format.
  
-  Each one should be around 3 paragraphs - approximately 12-14 sentences, with an introduction and closing. If you can understand the  basic format of a Cover Letter you will see that they are simple to write out for any job you are applying to



- Hopefully after a few drafts, you'll be able to write Cover Letters easily, and won't have to stay up until Midnight

- *"“Second, third, and hundredth chances balancing on breaking (git?) branches”*

### Chat GPT / AI for Cover Letters

- You are not the first person to think "I'll just have AI write this for me". You won't be the last one either.
- Don't do it. People whose jobs it is to read applications can spot an AI written Cover Letter 10 words in. AI simply can not write to the level of ethos, pathos, and gravitas that you will want to have in a strong, professional cover letter.
- If you are not willing to put the effort in to write the 100 or so words that make up a cover letter, interviewers and readers can assume that you will not put the effort in to actually do the work the job entails. Which means you may be starting off the application process on Strike 1. You may think this is a way to save time, it may actually make you look like a weaker candidate.

Are you willing to risk your entire professional Reputation on somethign so simple?

- Sorry... *"so casually cruel in the name of being honest"*


### Cover Letter Make Up

- As we have said, you may have multiple drafts of your letters saved for you to submit for different jobs. You may need to change up a few of the details, but the format is fairly standard.

- Here is the basic structure of a Cover Letter, which we will break down line by line. Like a resume and a portfolio, this is *not* something you'll make once and never update. In fact, its something you may want to change up frequently

- We can show you this make up, *you'll* need to actually fill in the details!

- *You* get to write your own story in this, and define the narrative you want to create. *You* get to write your own Folklore
